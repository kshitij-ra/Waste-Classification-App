This is an Android app that uses machine learning to classify images of waste into six categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. It was built using Flutter, a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.

- The dataset used can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification).
- Learn more about the ML model trained by accessing the kaggle notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kshitijradotra/waste-classification-inceptionv3).

## Features

    - Take a photo or select an image from your gallery
    - Classify the image using a machine learning model trained on waste images
    - See the classification result (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, or trash)
    - [TODO] Get more information about the waste category and how to properly dispose of it.

## Technologies used

    - Flutter 2.0+
    - TensorFlow Lite for machine learning
    - InceptionV2 model
